# Enabling the Firewall

Once you have established a secure operating system, and are only running neccesary apps, you can enable more defenses to protect your system from outside attack.  Even legitimate applications need to connect to the outside world, which is where a firewall comes in. A firewall helps to filter out some malware coming through the network before it even reaches your computer's other defenses.

In this analogy, a firewall is like a moat that is employed to protect the castle. The moat can stop malware from entering the castle so that it never has to chance to try to get through the other defenses. In this simulation, remove the drawbridge so that only data can pass, but malware does not. Click the bridge to remove it, and click again in the same place to restore it. Be careful to lose any data!
