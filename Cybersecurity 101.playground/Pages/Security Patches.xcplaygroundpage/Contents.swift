 # Security Patches
 
 A crucial part of securing a computer is having a secure and trusted foundation to build upon. A computer's operating system (OS) is responsible for running your apps and managing your data. It's important to make sure that the latest security updates are installed to close known vulnerabilities.
 
 Not installing security patches to the operating system is like leaving the gates to a castle open for attackers to walk right in and steal resources. While there are multiple security measures designed to defend against malware, these may be rendered useless if a severe vulnerability is exploited in the operating system.
