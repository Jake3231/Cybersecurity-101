 Thank you for trying out my Playground, and I hope that it was informative. I have been a competitor in the Air Force Association CyberPatriot competition for two years, and my team has placed each year. I am excited to apply my experience from this competition in a way that can help others. My passion is building great products that make technology more accessible, and I beleive that cybersecurity is an area in need of better software solutions.
